                  equipped with quantum computers is a major research direction
                  fostered by the US National Institute of Standards and
                  Technology (NIST) Post-quantum Cryptography Standardization
                  process. Among the viable candidates, code-based asymmetric
                  cryptosystems are one of the prominent approaches. In this
                  work, we propose the first fully detailed quantum circuit to
                  compute the solution to the Information Set Decoding problem,
                  the main cryptanalytic tool against such cryptosystems. We
                  evaluate the cryptanalytic effort with our circuit design on
                  actual parameters from cryptosystems admitted to the final
                  stage of the NIST standardization process and compare it with
                  the previous conservative asymptotic estimates. We show that
                  the actual computational effort of our solution is smaller
                  than the one estimated via asymptotics by a factor of \(2^4\) . We
                  also perform a comparison of our results with the
                  quantum-computational effort of breaking the AES cipher,
                  following the guidelines of the US NIST in evaluating the
                  security of the ciphers. To do this, we translate our design
                  on gates of the Clifford+T gate set only, one of the most
                  promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation,
                  and report that the parameter choices for Classic McEliece and
                  BIKE, two candidates admitted to the final round of the NIST
                  standardization process provide an adequate security margin
                  with respect to our ISD solution technique.},

  abstract = {In the race for quantum-safe cryptography, fostered by the ongoing
                  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
                  post-quantum standardization process, it is crucial to assess
                  the security of the emerging cryptoschemes. In this work, we
                  propose a fully quantum algorithm to accelerate the
                  Lee-Brickell's Information Set Decoding (ISD) on binary error
                  correcting codes — one of the main cryptanalytic techniques
                  used for assessing the security of code-based cryptoschemes.
                  Our solution relies on a careful scheduling of the quantum
                  gates included in the circuit design, coupled with a strategy
                  that applies multiple times the oracle-reflection, from a
                  Grover-like search, within a single Grover iteration. Compared
                  with the state-of-the-art alternatives, our solution shows a
                  reduction of the circuit depth ranging between 2^3 and 2^26,
                  when considering the parameters sets for code-based
                  cryptosystems advanced to the fourth round of the NIST
                  process. Denoting as t and t-p the two sets of bit flips
                  tackled by the Lee-Brickell's strategy, as an additional
                  noteworthy fact we show that our solution exhibits 1 as the
                  best value for p instead of 2 as it is the case for the
                  classic ISD. }

                  promising approach to solve computational problems across
                  various domains, including combinatorial optimization, and
                  cryptography. Stating a generic search problem in terms of a
                  (quantum) search over a graph makes the efficiency of the
                  algorithmic method depend on the structure of the graph
                  itself. In this work, we propose a complete implementation of
                  a quantum walk search on Johnson graphs, speeding up the
                  solution of the subset-sum problem. We provide a detailed
                  design of each sub-circuit, quantifying their cost in terms of
                  gate number, depth, and width. We compare our solution against
                  a Grover quantum search, showing a reduction of the T-count
                  and T-depth for practically solvable problems. The proposed
