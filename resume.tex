\begin{rSection}{Research interests}
  My research revolves around the quantum computing field; at the moment, I am
  focusing on the design and development of new algorithms and the analysis of
  their complexity.

  My Ms.C. thesis was focused on the Information Set Decoding problem, up to now
  the most efficient attack against cryptosystems based on linear codes. With
  the help of my advisors, I designed a quantum version of this kind of attack,
  that relies at its core on a modified version of Grover's algorithm. The
  proposed algorithm was completedly implemented and tested with linear codes of
  different sizes using the IBM's Qiskit framework.

  During my months as an intern at Atos, I mainly focused on the exploration of
  algorithms for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) architectures, that are
  probably the only type of Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) that will be available
  in the near-term future. In this field, I am trying to explore the power of
  the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which may be used to
  efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems with the aid of the
  aforementioned NISQ computeres.

  My Ph.D.\ research activities, supervised by Prof.\ Gerardo Pelosi and Prof.\
  Alessandro Barenghi, revolved around the topic of Post-Quantum cryptography.
  Notably, one of the major quest in the quantum and cryptography communities is
  the evaluation of new cryptographic standards capable of resisting to attacks
  from quantum accelerated computers. The search is witnessed by the call for
  standard carried out by, among the others, the National Institute of Standards
  and Technology (NIST), that is expected to lead to draft of standards
  available by the end of 2023. For this reason, practical evaluation of the
  computational complexity required to attack the proposed Post-Quantum
  cryptoschemes will be carried out during the research activity.

  % Finally, the quantification of the speed-up attainable in solving problems which remain computationally hard even with a quantum computer being available (e.g., problems characterizing cryptanalytic tasks, such as the subset sum problem), will be tackled.

% today is around algorithms for Noise
% %%%%
% The research activity will focus on the following topics: the development of new quantum algorithms, the analysis of their complexity, practical feasibility and scalability on the Quantum Learning Machine provided by AtoS, and applications of quantum techniques to problems in classical computer science and mathematics.

% Currently, it is an open question if quantum heuristics can outperform classical approximation techniques. Aiming to advance the state-of-the-art, the investigation will start from the study of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA), to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems with the aid of quantum computers.

% Given the interest in the research community for quantum computer technologies, named Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ), having 50 qubits or more and not equipped with fully developed error correction mechanisms, the said optimization algorithms will be tackled to fit also computations in the NISQ technology.

% Finally, the quantification of the speed-up attainable in solving problems which remain computationally hard even with a quantum computer being available (e.g., problems characterizing cryptanalytic tasks, such as the subset sum problem), will be tackled.

% %%%%
% In recent times, I am investigating the power of quantum computers, with a special 
% focus on cryptography. For my master thesis, I learned how to use the Qiskit 
% framework, proposing patches to Aqua. 

% I have extensively use Qiskit to implement several quantum circuits to solve
% the Information Set Decoding problem, one of the key aspects of post-quantum
% cryptography.

% While waiting to invest all the energies on my Ph.D. research on quantum computing,
% I am working as an intern at Atos. These months of work helped me to consolidate
% my knowledge on the topic, to see the state of the art of quantum simulation and to
% test all the new improvements made to the QLM project.
